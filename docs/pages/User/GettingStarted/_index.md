## The fast path to Liqo

Liqo requires the following three steps to be up and running:

* [Install Liqo](./install): install Liqo on a first cluster (*home* cluster).
* [Peer to a foreign cluster](./peer): establish a peering with a second Liqo cluster (*foreign* cluster).
  * If you do not know who peer with, you may need to install Liqo on a second cluster.
* [Exploit foreign resources](./test): start an *Hello World* application to verify that the two peered clusters can actually share resources correctly and that you are able to run a pod in a foreign cluster.

In addition, Liqo provides a user-friendly [Dashboard](../dashboard), which can be used to configure and inspect the most important parameters of the system.
